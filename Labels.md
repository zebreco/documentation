# LABELS

Labels are a fully customisable system for tracking in-house ticket management. Labels can be set up to categorise issues with descriptive titles such as **bug** or **enquiry**. They can have unique colours and category. Labels can then be applied to tickets.

Here is an example of a ticket title with two labels attached to it:

![Labels07](/images/labels/labels07.png)  

You can see it has been labelled as being a kind *question* and has a priority of *low*.

Labels persist across the platform and they can be used to view your lists with filtered information, only showing items with the associated labels. First we will need to create a new label.

## Creating a New Label

To create a new label first go to **Account** >> **Labels**

![Labels01](/images/labels/labels01.png)

On this screen you will see there are no labels created yet. Click on **New Label**.

![Labels03](/images/labels/labels03.png)

In the pop-up proceed to enter the required details for the label:

 * **Name**     - *descriptive name for the label.*
 * **Colour**   - *desired overlay colour for the label.*
 * **Category** - *which category the label falls under.*

When you are ready click the green **save icon** in the top right.

Here we have created a ticket with the **name** *support-required*, the **colour** *blue* and the **type** is set to *ticket*.

## Editing Labels

To edit a created label simply click on the label you wish to edit. From the pop-up you can edit the name and colour of the label but not the category.


## Deleting Labels

To delete a created label first select the label you wish to delete with the check box and then **delete**.
