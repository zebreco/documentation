Labels are used to categorise tickets and give specific information such as priority or status.\n\n\n\n\nIn this example we apply a label 'support-required' to the new ticket.\n\n\n\n\nTask Creation\n\n\nOn the right hand navigation bar you will find a section named 'Tasks'. This is where you can add new tasks or task tracks to your ticket. We will not be going into detail about task creation here.

This is where you can set the tickets time status (whether work on the ticket is chargeable or under a payment plan for example) and allocate time spent working on it. For this example we will add a simple 10 minutes of work and make it chargeable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViewing Tickets\n\n\nClicking back on the 'Tickets' tab will take us to the Tickets overview.

Simply select the required filter from the drop down menu or use the quick filter from the navigation bar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReplying to Tickets\n\n\nWhen you are ready to reply to a ticket, simply click on \nReply\n \n\n\n\n\nThis brings up the reply dialog where you can input your communication and choose the required reply type.\n\n\n\n\nThere are three options for replying, they act slightly differently and are as follows:\n\n\n\n\nReply \n Keep Open\n - This will reply to the ticket and keep the ticket status on 'open', this may be useful if follow up tasks/communication will be carried out.\n\n\nReply \n Close\n - This will close the ticket after replying. This is useful when a problem has been solved or answered inthe reply and will require no further input.\n\n\nReply\n - This will also keep the ticket status open but apply an 'Awaiting Reply' status which helps to further categorise the ticket as an ongoing issue. This is the default reply status and is most widely used during ticket progression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nAt this stage you will be asked to log any time for the ticket that is relevant (for example if the ticket is set to chargeable under time status). This is done via the standard \nedit\n box which should pop-up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo complete the reply, click on the \nSave\n icon.\n\n\n\n\nReplying With a Private Note\n\n\nTo make the reply private (only viewable from within your organisation) simply check the box \n'Private Note'\n. This will change the options to:\n\n\n\n\nAdd Note \n Close\n - Add the private note and set the ticket status to 'closed'.\n\n\nAdd Note\n - Add the private note and leave the ticket status unchanged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nThe private note will display with a yellow background to signify its privacy. This note will only be viewable to those members within your organisation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompleting a Task in Ticket View\n\n\nFrom the ticket view you can view all associated tasks on the right hand tab. Here you can see the task we created earlier 'Reply to ticket'.
