For more detailed information on each of these settings search for their respective sections in this documentation.\n\n\n\n\nOnce created your ticket should look like the above example (note by default the ticket status is set to open)\n\n\n\n\nTicket Assignment\n\n\nOnce your ticket exists you can make various assignments in order to categorise it within your system. Please note this system is highly configurable and may be different for your organisation but the principle and process of assignment remains the same.\n\n\nOn the left hand option bar, we will assign the ticket to ourselves (in this case the user is called 'Zebreco Support').

For this example we will add a simple 10 minutes of work and make it chargeable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViewing Tickets\n\n\nClicking back on the 'Tickets' tab will take us to the Tickets overview.

This is useful when a problem has been solved or answered inthe reply and will require no further input.\n\n\nReply\n - This will also keep the ticket status open but apply an 'Awaiting Reply' status which helps to further categorise the ticket as an ongoing issue. This is the default reply status and is most widely used during ticket progression.\n\n\n\n\nNote: at this stage you will be asked to log any time for the ticket that is relevant (for example if the ticket is set to chargeable under time status).
