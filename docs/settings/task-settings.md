# Task Settings

## Tracks

Tracks are used to create fully customisable task pathways. These are useful if tasks are repeated accross projects. In the example below there are a number of tracks created including *Design* and *Build*. Each track contains a numnber of standardised tasks which will applied to the chosen project should each track be associated with it.

To create a new track click on **New Track**.

![tasks02](/images/settings/tasks02.png "Task Track Creation")

Above is the task track for our example *Build*. It has been setup with all common tasks often acted upon during the build of a web project. By applying this task track to a project, all tasks within will be assigned to the project. From here you can add a **New Track Task** or delete current ones.
