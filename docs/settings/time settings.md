# Time Settings

Here we can create, delete and edit existing time statuses. These are the different states which can be assigned to tickets/tasks and tell the system how to handle chargeable time. 

There are three default statuses built into the system:

* **Chargeable** - the time applied will be chargeable.
* **Not Chargeable** - the time applied will not be chargeable.
* **Invoiced** - the time applied has been invoiced.

&nbsp;

To create a new time status click on **New Time Status**

To **edit** an existing time status (non-system) simply click on it. You can edit the **Name**, **State** and set whether it is the **Default** status.
