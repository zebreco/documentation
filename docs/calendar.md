## Calendar Filters

The calendar will show more than just events you have added. If there is a project with a start and end date it will appear on the calendar. Tasks with set dates will also appear and the same applies to tickets. In order to view these ensure the required filter is checked.

You can also filter by users. This will display projects, tickets, tasks and events only applicable to the selected users. In this case we only have one user but it is likely your organisation will have multiple users and so this could be very useful for viewing a particular users commitments. 

The final filter under settings is whether to show weekends or not.
