Time can be applied from around the site some of these methods will be listed below.

## Viewing Time

The time dashboard shows a list of all recorded time. Each item shows who logged the time, the length of time and the date it was logged. It will also list the contact and project related to the log.

On the time dashboard you can filter which time items you view by a number of statuses. To do so bring down the filter menu from above the list and choose a filter.
